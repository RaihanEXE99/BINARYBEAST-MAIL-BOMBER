### What is Mail Bomber?

An email bomb or "mail bomb" is a malicious act in which a large number of [email](https://techterms.com/definition/email) messages are sent to a single email address in a short period. The purpose of an email bomb is typical to overflow a user's [inbox](https://techterms.com/definition/inbox).

 - 🐱‍💻Added Terminal design to give you hacker man vibe XD

- ✨ With Among us background sound effect when you start an attack

  

- Removed Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook login support. ( Otherwise, people will think I'm storing their email password 🙂 in DB)
